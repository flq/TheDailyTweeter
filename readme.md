## Dependencies ##

Dependencies can be found in the "**lib**" subfolder. Some dependencies enter the system via 
[openwrap](http://www.openwrap.org). With time it is planned to let all deps enter that way.

To have more fun with the Observables, it is recommended you use the Reactive framework. The 2 important dlls are **System.Reactive.dll** and **System.CoreEx.dll**.
The additional WPF Application dependencies are contained in the **WpfApp subfolder** of the lib:

* [Caliburn.Micro.dll](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/)
    * System.Windows.Interactivity.dll
* [Twitterizer2.dll](http://www.twitterizer.net/)
    * Twitterizer.Data.dll
    * [Newtonsoft.Json.dll](http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx)
